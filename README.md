# UConn Coding Bootcamp: Pre-work Study Guide

## Description

This is a pre-work study guide for the UConn Coding Bootcamp. The goal is to give students an overview of the main aspects of web development: HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. This project was built to help prepare students for the course so they are ready to go on the first day of class.

## Usage

There are 4 sections to the study guide: HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. Each section contains notes on the respective topic. The content and layout of the webpage were coded using HTML and CSS. Changes to the code were recorded and saved using git. To see JavaScript in action, open the DevTools in the browser (command+option+I on Mac and Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows) and go to Console. Once there, the user is asked which language they'd like to study first. Happy coding!

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
